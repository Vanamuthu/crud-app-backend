The object of scripts in "package.json" can be used to perform certain operations, like
start: node index.json
npm run start => this will run the server

npmjs.com => to install the dependencies
npm i express
npm i nodemon
npm i mongoose

Adding files to .gitignore, will omit files from pushing it to the repo

Use nodemon to reflect the changes made server when saved and refreshed.
